And  the king  sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, \"Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door.  Is  not the sound of his masterâ€™s feet behind him?\""
